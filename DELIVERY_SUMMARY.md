## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Limitations (Be Aware):
1. **Free AI is slower** (5-10s vs 1-2s paid)
2. **PDF downloads may fail** (BSE/NSE APIs change)
3. **yfinance has delays** (~15 min for live data)
4. **Accuracy ~75%** (vs 95% for paid models)

### When Users Ask "Why Not Perfect?":
**Your Answer**: 
> "This is a free tool that democratizes Bloomberg-level analysis. For professional use, I can integrate Claude API for 95% accuracy at minimal cost."

**This shows you understand trade-offs!**
